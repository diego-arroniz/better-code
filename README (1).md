# Design Patterns

## Design Patterns

JavaScript design patterns are templates for repeatable solutions to common problems in JavaScript application development.

The idea is simple: programmers around the world, since the early days of development, have faced recurring sets of problems when developing applications. Over time, some developers decided to document proven ways to address these problems so others could easily reference the solutions.

### Types of JavaScript Design Patterns

Here are some of the most popular classifications of JavaScript design patterns:

#### Creational Patterns

Creational design patterns are those that help solve problems related to the creation and management of new instances of objects in JavaScript. It can be as simple as limiting a class to having only one object or as complex as defining an intricate method for selecting and manually adding each feature in a JavaScript object.

Some examples of creational design patterns are Singleton, Factory, Abstract Factory, and Builder, among others.

#### Structural Patterns

Structural design patterns are those that help solve problems related to managing the structure (or schema) of JavaScript objects. These problems can include creating a relationship between two different objects or abstracting some features of an object for specific users.

Some examples of structural design patterns are Adapter, Bridge, Composite, and Facade.

#### Behavioral Patterns

Behavioral design patterns are those that help solve problems regarding how control (and responsibility) is passed between various objects. These problems might involve controlling access to a linked list or establishing a single entity that can control access to various types of objects.

Some examples of behavioral design, [Iterator](design-patterns/iterator.md), [Memento](design-patterns/memento.md), and [Observer](design-patterns/observer.md).

#### Concurrency Patterns

Concurrency design patterns are those that help solve problems related to multithreading and multitasking. These problems can involve maintaining an active object among multiple available objects or handling multiple events delivered to a system by demultiplexing the incoming input and handling it piece by piece.

Some examples of concurrency design patterns are Active Object, Reactor, and Scheduler.

#### Architectural Patterns

Architectural design patterns are those that help solve problems related to software design in a broad sense. They are usually related to how you design your system and ensure high availability, mitigate risks, and avoid performance bottlenecks.

Two examples of architectural design patterns are MVC and MVVM.
