# Iterator

#### Iterator

The Iterator pattern is quite simple and is used very frequently in almost all modern object-oriented languages. If you find yourself with the task of traversing a list of objects that are not all of the same type, normal iteration methods like a `for` loop can become quite complicated â€” especially if you are also writing business logic within them.

The Iterator pattern can help you isolate the iteration and processing logic of your lists from the main business logic.

Here is how you can use it on a fairly basic list with multiple types of items:

<pre class="language-javascript"><code class="lang-javascript"><strong>function Iterator(list) { 
</strong>   this.list = list; 
   this.index = 0;

   this.current = function() { 
       return this.list[this.index]; 
   };

   this.next = function() { 
       return this.list[this.index++]; 
   };

   this.hasNext = function() { 
       return this.index &#x3C; this.list.length; 
   };

   this.resetIndex = function() { 
       this.index = 0; 
   };

   this.forEach = function(callback) { 
       for (let element = this.next(); this.index &#x3C;= this.list.length; element = this.next()) { 
           callback(element); 
       } 
   };
}

function run() { 
   let list = ["Lorem ipsum", 9, ["lorem ipsum dolor", true], false];

   let iterator = new Iterator(list);

   console.log(iterator.current());
   // Output: Lorem ipsum 

   while (iterator.hasNext()) { 
       console.log(iterator.next()); 
       /** 
        * Output: 
        * Lorem ipsum 
        * 9 
        * [ 'lorem ipsum dolor', true ] 
        * false 
        */ 
   }

   iterator.resetIndex();

   iterator.forEach(function (element) { 
       console.log(element); 
   });
   /** 
    * Output: 
    * Lorem ipsum 
    * 9 
    * [ 'lorem ipsum dolor', true ] 
    * false 
    */ 
}

run();
</code></pre>

Needless to say, this pattern can be unnecessarily complex for lists without multiple types of elements. Additionally, if there are too many types of elements in a list, it can also become difficult to manage.

The key is to identify if you really need an iterator based on your list and its possibilities for change in the future. Additionally, the Iterator pattern is only useful in lists, and lists can sometimes limit you to their linear mode of access. Other data structures can sometimes provide greater performance advantages.
